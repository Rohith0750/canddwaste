    <h1>Innovative Solutions for Managing Construction and Demolition Waste Using Raspberry Pi</h1>

    <p>This research explores innovative solutions for managing construction and demolition (C&D) waste, specifically using Raspberry Pi technology. Raspberry Pi is being utilized for automation, monitoring, and managing the waste generated from construction activities. The system leverages sensors and data analytics to ensure efficient waste management practices, thus minimizing environmental impacts and promoting recycling.</p>

    <p>The study provides insights into how Raspberry Pi can be employed to monitor waste levels, track the types of materials being discarded, and optimize sorting processes, ensuring that recyclable materials are handled effectively. Additionally, it highlights the potential for integrating smart waste management systems into large-scale construction projects to streamline operations and reduce costs.</p>
